Wally 2.4.5

Wally is a Qt4 wallpaper changer, using multiple sources like files, folders, FTP remote folders, Flickr, Panoramio,
Ipernity, Photobucket, Buzznet, Picasa, Smugmug, Google, Vladstudio and deviantART images.
It runs under Linux, Win32, MacOSX and OS/2, and it's available in many languages.

Some features:
- History support
- EXIF support
- Proxy support
- A lot of wallpaper layouts, independent from window manager's capabilities
- Save downloaded pictures

Requirements:
- Qt 4.6.0 or better
- Libexif 0.6 or better (optional)
- CMake 2.8 or better (in order to build from sources)

Installation:
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  ( ^^^^^ please type just like you read ^^^^^^^ )
- make
- make install (Linux only)

CMake options:
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release      compile in Release mode
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug        compile in Debug mode
-DSTATIC=1                      link with static libraries (only if Qt4 has been compiled in static mode)
-DCOMPRESS=1                    compress final executable with UPX (only Win32 and MacOSX)

If you have KDE4, your enviroment will be automatically detected, and WallyPlugin will be installed. Remember to restart KDE4
(logoff/logon should be enough) in order to use Wally. Then, select WallyPlugin in Appearance Settings. To be clear, WallyPlugin IS NOT Wally.
It's just a "brigde" between Wally and KDE4, and it must be selected to show Wally images, so Wally has to be started.

Moreover, if you're upgrading KDE4 to KDE 4.4, and you already have WallyPlugin, Plasma can crash, due to binary incompatibilites with
new Qt/KDE libraries. Just reinstall/recompile Wally.

When launched, Wally places itself in your system tray. Right-click on icon to show main menu.
In Settings window, just select a module, and add items in the list. Wally will download photos according to your search keywords,
or use your photos if you're using Files / Folders modules.

Supported Window Managers:
- Win32
- MacOSX
- OS/2
- KDE3
- KDE4
- Gnome
- GnomeShell
- XFCE4
- Fluxbox
- Blackbox
- FVWM (unstable)
- WindowMaker

Please read README.XFCE4 and README.shortcuts for further instructions.

Note for Mac OSX Snow Leopard:
You must disable "Change Picture" feature, that's in System preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Change picture.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Wally has been deeply inspired by John's Background Switcher (http://www.johnsadventures.com/software/backgroundswitcher),
a great software, well designed and much more capable than Wally. Infact, it's still running on one of my PCs :)
Anyway, I decided to write Wally for two reasons:

- JBS is based on .NET, a framework that is not installed on every PC, cause of its "heaviness" and system resources' usage.
- And, mainly, it cannot run on platforms like Linux / MacOSX.

So, I'd like to thank John Conners, for giving me the opportunity to re-use its idea in order to fulfill the universe
of wallpaper changers not covered by JBS :)

First of all, I'd like to thank Tanya, my wife, for all her support before, during Wally's development and
after :)

I'd also like to thank:

- for bugs reporting, new ideas and time spent in testing:

  Sylvain Gueniot
  Oliver Schwabedissen
  Ferhat Dogru
  Corrado Guarino Lo Bianco
  Filippo Venturini
  Klaus-Peter Gores
  Mike Cooper
